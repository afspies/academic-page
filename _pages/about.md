I am an Msc student in AI and ML at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/research/artificial-intelligence/') - currently enrolled in taught courses addressing modern connectionist AI approaches, as well as a number of courses on "Good Old Fashioned AI". As a novice, I have opted for an egalitarian prior, and believe that the "right answer" will probably draw from both schools of thought; consequently, I am also learning about neuro-symbolic approaches to AI as part of an Independent Study Module under the supervision of [Prof. A Russo](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/).

## Sales Pitch
I am driven by curiosity and a passion for advancing the boundaries of human knowledge by tackling challenging problems, especially when doing so has the potential to improve human lives.

I have spent considerable time performing research, having worked on pixel detectors with B. Nachman at LBNL (Berkeley), and on automated atrial fibrillation diagnosis under the supervision of Prof. H. Zhang at the University of Manchester.

Having learnt about both the incredible progress and thorny challenges present in the fields of deep learning and AI more generally, I decided to pursue an MSc at Imperial College London, specializing in AI. At present I am most excited by neuro-symbolic approaches to AI as these may yield models which address the shortcomings of both methods individually; yielding greater data efficiency, and (out of distribution) generalizability, whilst also allowing for easier integration of expert knowledge and vastly superior interpretability (a desirable feature for algorithms which are becoming increasingly ubiquitous).
